# Database Seeding Guide

This guide explains how to use the seed script to populate your portfolio database with sample data.

## Overview

The `seed.py` script creates:
- **9 Projects**: 3 featured projects + 6 regular projects
- **4 Experience Entries**: Realistic work history with different companies
- **1 Site Metadata Record**: Hero content, bio, and social links
- **9 Placeholder Images**: Sample project screenshots (to be replaced)

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure your Flask app is properly configured
2. Database tables must exist (run migrations if needed):
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```
3. Install all required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Seed Script

From the project root directory:

```bash
python backend/seed.py
```

Or from the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
python seed.py
```

### What the Script Does

1. **Clears existing data** from all tables (⚠️ **Warning**: This will delete all current data)
2. **Creates sample projects** with realistic descriptions and tech stacks
3. **Adds work experience** entries with bullet points and technologies
4. **Sets up site metadata** including hero content and social links
5. **Creates placeholder images** for all projects

## After Seeding

### 1. Replace Placeholder Images

Navigate to `content/images/projects/` and replace the placeholder files with actual project screenshots:

- Recommended size: 800x600px or 16:9 aspect ratio
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
- Keep the same filenames as generated by the script

### 2. Customize Content via Admin Panel

1. Start your Flask development server
2. Navigate to `/admin` in your browser
3. Log in with your admin credentials
4. Update the seeded data with your personal information:
   - Edit project descriptions and links
   - Update experience entries with your work history
   - Modify site metadata (name, bio, social links)

### 3. Verify the Data

You can verify the seeded data by:

1. Checking the admin panel at `/admin`
2. Making API requests to test endpoints:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5001/api/projects
   curl http://localhost:5001/api/experience
   curl http://localhost:5001/api/meta
   ```

2. **Full Stack Developer** at StartupXYZ (2020-2022)
3. **Frontend Developer** at Digital Agency Pro (2019-2020)
4. **Software Development Intern** at University Research Lab (2018)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database connection errors:**
- Ensure your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set correctly
- Check that the database server is running

**Permission errors:**
- Make sure the `content/images/projects/` directory is writable
- Check file permissions on the backend directory

**Import errors:**
- Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Ensure you're running the script from the correct directory

### Re-running the Script

The script can be run multiple times safely. It will:
1. Clear all existing data first
2. Create fresh sample data
3. Preserve any uploaded images (they become orphaned but won't be deleted)

**⚠️ Warning**: Running the script will delete all current data including any customizations you've made through the admin panel.

## Production Considerations

**Never run this script in production** as it will delete all real data. For production environments:

1. Create a separate seeding script with your actual content
2. Use database migrations for schema changes
3. Consider using fixtures or data imports instead of clearing all data

## Next Steps

After seeding:
1. Replace placeholder images with actual project screenshots
2. Customize the content through the admin panel
3. Test all API endpoints to ensure data is accessible
4. Start the frontend development server to see your portfolio in action
